REM This is optional; you might like to prefix all images wit something indicating the collection it came from.
REM If you use it, make sure that your index.txt uses the same names as what this produces, including the prefix
REM and file extension (e.g. .png and .jpg).
REM If you don't want to add  prefix to the files, set this to just "set PREFIX="  (i.e. nothing after the equals sign).
set PREFIX=shape_
REM This is optional, if you want to watermark each image. Otherwise, set to ""
REM Note that the approach used below is pretty ugly, and we don't use it for Art Of Reading.
REM It would not be hard to instead have a the watermark done as a semi-transparent image instead of this black text.
REM But either way, it's going to expand/shrink with the image, so not so practicle.

REM Window batch file information that is key to understanding some of this:
REM 	the loop parameter has to start with a %, so whenever it is referenced, that has to be doubled, so we get %%1
REM 	%~n1 equals the file name of %1 without the file extension
REM		to use constants surround them with "%",
REM 	to use looped indices with special macros, do like this (this one is for the index "1") %~n1,
REM 	to use local variables that change, surround with "!" (and have "setlocal enabledelayedexpansion" at the start of the bat the file).
